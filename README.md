# N-Queens, SAT, and Sudoku Solver README

## Introduction
Welcome to our Artificial Intelligence project repository! This project is a part of our coursework in AI at FIEK. In this project, we focus on solving complex problems using informed search techniques, Constraint Programming, and SAT problem-solving strategies.

## Project Overview

##Phase 2
This project is divided into three main components: the N-Queens Problem Solver, the SAT Problem Solver, and the Sudoku Solver. Each component is designed to apply specific artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms.

### N-Queens
Solving the N-Queens problem using the A* algorithm and proposing an admissible heuristic.
Problem Description: Solving the N-Queens problem using the A* algorithm and proposing an admissible heuristic.
Implementation Details: We implemented the A* algorithm with a heuristic that calculates the number of remaining queens to be placed on the board. The solution efficiently finds a safe placement for all queens on a given size board.

### SAT Problem Solver:
Problem Description: Arranging 100 guests at 10 tables with specific seating constraints.
Approach: We defined a SAT formula that models the problem, considering the constraints about which guests can or cannot sit at the same table.

### Sudoku Solver
Solving Sudoku by applying Constraint Programming with Google's OR-Tools. The model sets up variables for each cell, enforces unique number constraints on rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids, and utilizes a CP solver to find valid solutions or report if the puzzle is unsolvable.
